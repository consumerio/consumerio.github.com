================

Ordering vinyl banners can be kind of intimidating.  Here's a handy guide that walks you through the process:

1. Find out the size of the table, booth, or awning where the banner will hang.

If the banners are for a trade show or conference, check the event website to see what size the booths and tables will be.  Contact the organizers if there's nothing on the website.  

If the banners are for an awning, business, fence, or other physical location, go and measure the area where the banner will hang.

Not sure of sizes?  Go with a 6-foot or 8-foot banner with a height of 2-3 feet.

2. Poke around online until you find a cheap place to order banners of the size you want.  The best deals I could find today were:

* $12 for 2'x5' and $28 for 3'x8' color vinyl banners, BannersOnTheCheap - http://bannersonthecheap.com
* $6.99 for 3'x2' color vinyl banners, Banner Buzz - http://bannerbuzz.com 

3. Use the online design tools to put together your banner graphic.  Choose a color combination that stands out.  Here are the most useful signage design tips I found:

* Color contrasts, from most to least visible: http://www.outdoorfirst.com/ColorContrasts.aspx

4. Order your banners!  Keep in mind that the first printing often has mistakes, so allow enough time for you to order a second print run if needed.

If your banner will be hanging from posts, a chainlink fence, or mounted to a building, you'll want to choose to have it grommetted during the order process.  The online shop should give you that option; if not, look at other shops.  You can then get zip ties at the hardware store to mount your banner through the grommets.

5. If you don't have a place to mount your banner, order a banner stand.  Indoor stands tend to be more polished-looking, while outdoor stands have a more rugged appearance.  

If you're not sure where your banner will go, choose an outdoor stand.  Outdoor stands usually have a weighted base that can be filled with sand or water, to keep your banner from falling down in the wind.
