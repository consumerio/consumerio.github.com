================

National Consumer Protection Week (NCPW) is an annual campaign held by government consumer protection agencies, nonprofits, and local consumer organizations.  

Various events will be held throughout the United States, educating people about consumer rights and helping consumers take full advantage of these rights.

The 14th annual NCPW will be held March 4-10, 2012.  

Keep watching this website for announcements about online and offline consumer events.  Weâ€™ll be broadcasting information about every event that we hear about.  

If your consumer organization is running an NCPW event this year, please email consumerrights@consumernotebook.com so that we can help get the word out to consumers.  We want to help as many consumer organizations as we can.
