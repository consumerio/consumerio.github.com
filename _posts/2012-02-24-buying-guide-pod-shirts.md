================

If you've ever ordered custom t-shirts with your own graphics online, odds are that you've ended up with poor quality, unwearable shirts.

Well, if you know what you're doing, you can actually get very good quality results.  It does take knowledge of prepress work, but I'm going to try and outline how to do this:

1. Don't even bother with Photoshop.  Use a vector graphics editor.  Vector graphics look clean and crisp at any size.  Two of the most popular ones are Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator.  Here's a [comparison grid](http://consumernotebook.com/grids/audreyr/inkscape-0482-vs-adobe-illustrator-cs5/) I made of them.  If you're not sure which one to get, choose Inkscape because it's what I use.

2. Design your graphic using as few colors as possible.  Use just one to three colors.  Don't worry about having such few colors: if you look around in shops, you'll see that most graphic tees use only 1-2 colors.

    Use the pen tool to draw your artwork as paths.  If you don't know how, take the time to read tutorials and learn.  The results will make all the difference in the world.  

    Make sure that none of your paths overlap.  Think of each one of your paths as a filled-in area of ink.  You don't want your ink colors to overlap for print-on-demand orders.  Subtract any overlapping paths.  (Note: if you're ordering garments from a local shop or silkscreening them yourself, you can sometimes use overlapping inks, but your POD designs should be as clear as possible for the machines that print them.)

    If you have any strokes or text in your design, convert them all to paths to ensure that you get the same results that you see on your screen.

3. Save your file in the standard format that your vector graphics editor uses.  If you're using Inkscape, it should be an SVG file; if Adobe Illustrator, it should be an AI file.

4. Save a second copy of your file as an EPS file.  This is the file that you'll be uploading.

5. Choose an online print-on-demand shop that supports vector format.  I like to use Spreadshirt, but there are others.  Upload your EPS file.  You may see pages on the site asking you to upload JPG, BMP, GIF, TIF, PSD, and other bitmap format files, but don't do that.  Poke around and make sure that you can upload a vector file; if not, look for a different shop.

6. Carefully select garment colors that contrast well with your design.  I always do a Google image search for the t-shirt colors that I'm using, to ensure that the ink and fabric colors work well together.  

    Keep in mind that designing for print contrast is completely different from designing for the web.  For example, yellow lettering on a red background looks bad on a computer screen, but it's one of the most popular ink/fabric color combinations.

    If in doubt, print at least one version of your design on white t-shirts, using bold ink colors.  You're far less likely to run into contrast issues with dark colors on white fabric.

7. Choose well-fitted, high-quality fabrics and garments.  With print on demand, it's especially true that you get what you pay for.  I ordered shirts and jackets for us to wear at PyCon at our booth, and I made sure to get the higher quality shirts (costing $10-20 more) to make a better impression.

8. When you choose the shipping type for your POD order, consider that printing time and packaging time are separate from shipping time for most POD vendors.  For example, Spreadshirt offers standard 1-5 business day shipping, which doesn't include the 2 business days you have to allot for printing and packaging.  This isn't obvious during their checkout process: I found this out by searching their Help section.

Hope this guide helps!

Anyhow, I hope this was useful and educational.  

I'll be writing another buyer's guide at some point about how to order larger print runs of t-shirts from local printing shops.  Keep in mind that what I wrote above is for the situation where you're ordering just a few pieces for yourself and others.
