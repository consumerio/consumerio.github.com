1. Ask your employer if you can work from home 1 day per week.  That translates to 50 days of not driving per year, saving on high gas costs.
2. Spend 5 minutes making a sandwich before work every morning.  Throw in a banana, drink, and put some nuts in a zip-lock bag.
3. Whenever you use your washing machine, make sure that you fill it up. Don't run it with just a few items.
4. Spend 15 minutes calling 10 different car insurance companies to get quotes.  You can save $1000/year or more by shopping around.
5. Hire a plumber to fix all of the leaky faucets and running toilets around your house.  Those drips can add up to thousands of gallons of water wasted per year.
6. Turn off your computer when you're not using it.  That includes the monitor.  
7. Get some cheap power strips and put them all over your house.  Whenever you're not using a small appliance, switch off the power strip.  Most appliances use power even when they're not running.
8. Use [http://consumernotebook.com](http://consumernotebook.com/) to carefully track every purchase that you make or are planning to make. The more you plan and record, the less you'll spend money on unneeded items.
9. Order a weekly fruit and veggie delivery box from your local CSA, rather than buying produce at the grocery store.  It'll keep you from buying expensive out-of-season produce on impulse.
10. Rather than having someone build your website for you, use a free design template from [http://oswd.org](http://www.oswd.org/) and do it yourself.
11. Get a Brita pitcher rather than buying bottled water.
12. Before you buy gas, check for the cheapest prices at [http://gasbuddy.com](http://gasbuddy.com/).
13. Cut back on eating out.  If you eat out 3x/week, cut back to once every 2 weeks.
14. Save on gym costs by joining a free local hiking group.
15. If you can't give up your gym, switch to a gym closer to your home or work to save on gas costs. You won't save $10/month on a club membership if you have to drive 30 minutes each way to get there.
16. Take your morning shower at the gym after your workout, to save on water costs.
17. Spend a Saturday going through everything you own and figuring out what you don't need.  Put all of the small things on eBay, and put the large things on Craigslist for sale.
18. Whenever possible, wear extra layers and blankets instead of turning on the heater.
19. If you're only using one or two rooms of your house, use space heaters instead of your central heating system.
20. Learn how to cook from scratch.  Find frugal recipes online that can be made from scratch for $1-2 per serving or less.  You'll be surprised at all the gourmet meals you can make for so little money.  You'll be eating healthier too.
21. Instead of going to movie theaters, find local film festivals that have free or cheap tickets.  Join local film clubs that offer free screenings of movies at local colleges.
22. Make your own pizzas at home.  Pizza dough is simple to make from scratch; if you don't have time to wait for it to rise, you can buy mixes or premixed dough and make pizzas in 15 minutes.
23. Buy a lawn mower and mow the lawn yourself, instead of hiring a gardener.
24. Avoid owning clothing that requires dry cleaning or hand washing. Stick to washing machine friendly clothes.
25. Wash your clothes in cold water whenever possible.  They'll last longer, and you'll save on water heating costs.
26. Give up or cut back on drinking.  Alcoholic beverages are expensive.
27. Find low cost table wines that you like.  Stick to those rather than developing a taste for expensive wine.
28. Save on washing dishes by using oven-safe plates and bowls.  Cook in the plates/bowls that you eat in.
29. Weatherproof your windows in the winter months, to keep heat from escaping your home.
30. Make sure you have a discount card for your grocery store.  Use it every single time you go grocery shopping.
31. Save any receipts with coupons attached or on the back.  Grocery store-printed coupons are often targeted toward your spending habits and will be useful to you.
32. Put all the coupons that you might use in a folder in your car. You'll be ready with them whenever you're looking for a place to stop for lunch.
33. Take good care of your teeth.  Brush and floss them regularly. Getting cavities filled is expensive.
34. Instead of buying expensive 5-gallon paint buckets, buy up 5 one gallon "Oops" paint cans for $5 each.  Put them all into a 5-gallon bucket and mix them well.  You'll have a uniform neutral color that'll make walls look great. I've done this numerous times.
35. Trade babysitting with a trusted friend, rather than hiring a babysitter.
36. Find out about the nights that local museums are open to the public for free.  
37. When you're out shopping and you see things that you like, check prices online before you buy.  You're likely to find the same items online for less, and you can often buy online and then request in-store pickup within an hour.
38. Buy high-quality products that last longer when it matters.
39. Buy cheaper, lower-quality products in situations where you can get away with having the cheaper item.
40. Raise chickens and have fresh eggs every day.
41. Comparison-shop to see if you're paying too much for your cell phone plan.  You can often find deals from competing companies that want your business.
42. Travel with ultra-lightweight luggage.  You'll be less likely to accidentally go over the weight limits.  Also, if you find an ultralite carry-on bag, you'll be able to pack more stuff into it without being asked to check it in and pay a fee.
43. If you have a spare bedroom, rent it out on [http://airbnb.com](http://airbnb.com/).
44. Rather than going out for fondue, have a fondue party at your house.  Cheese fondue made from scratch is cheap.
45. Switch from using commercial software to free open-source alternatives whenever possible: operating systems, word processing, graphics editing tools, etc.
46. Find out where all the happy hour specials are.  You can often get a fancy gourmet burger for $5.
47. Cut back on going to meetups that are over 20 minutes away from your work or home.  If you like a meetup that's a long drive away, consider starting a similar one closer to home.  
48. Look into rebates that your water/power company offers for upgrading appliances, weatherproofing, switching to CFL bulbs, etc.
49. Search online for how to find unclaimed money in your state.  You may have money waiting for you.
50. If you go to a fast food restaurant, order off of the dollar menu.
51. Go to McDonald's for chocolate dipped cones rather than going to Coldstone for ice cream.  It's cheaper and you'll eat less.
52. Take advantage of your local library.  Borrow books and movies from there whenever possible. Get into the habit of returning your books every Saturday. Don't ever pay late fines.
53. Make birthday and holiday gifts.  Homemade crackers and cookies make great gifts.  Look online for interesting food gift recipes.
54. Rather than buying an espresso drink every day, buy a $30 espresso machine and learn how to make it yourself.  It's really easy once you do it for the first time.
55. Instead of going out for an expensive brunch buffet, go to the breakfast bar at Whole Foods.  You can get a plate full of the best quality bacon, eggs, creme brulee french toast, chilaquiles, denver egg whites, fresh cut fruit, etc. for $3-7.
56. Looking for fun daytime activities to do on weekends?  Consider volunteering somewhere interesting and giving back to the community, rather than paying for entertainment. You'll make a lot of friends and feel good about what you're doing.
57. The next time you plan a vacation, choose to go camping at a beautiful national park rather than going to an expensive resort.
58. Oatmeal is a healthy, filling, inexpensive breakfast.  Eggs and toast are also good, as is bran cereal. 
59. Thinking of buying something expensive? Thoroughly research your purchase before you make it.  Make a comparison grid [http://consumernotebook.com](http://consumernotebook.com/) of that item and four comparable other ones.  Be 100% sure that you're choosing the best product and making the right decision. You may save yourself from falling for a marketing campaign as an uninformed consumer.
60. Instead of buying expensive, mass-produced art prints for your walls, check out your local artist open studios event.  Artwork from local artists is often cheaper.  Or take some of your high-resolution vacation photos and have them enlarged and printed on large canvases, which costs less than you might expect.
61. If you go on a cruise, don't pay for expensive shore excursions. Research your destination cities and find interesting spots that you can walk or bicycle to.
62. When you travel to a different city, bring a folding bicycle and take public transit instead of renting a car.  
63. Find mystery hotel deals on [http://priceline.com](http://priceline.com/), then use [http://betterbidding.com](http://betterbidding.com/) to help you determine which hotel each one of the mystery listings is.
64. Get an American Express card. Use it whenever you rent a car to get free rental car insurance, provided as a perk by Amex.
65. Grow your own herbs in small pots by the kitchen.  You'll save a lot of money over buying fresh herbs. 
66. Don't throw away old rugs. Take them outside, scrub them with soap and water, and hang them to dry.  If you don't have a place to do this, try the local coin-operated car wash.
67. Before you buy a car, throughly research its fuel economy and cost of maintenance. Again, use [http://consumernotebook.com](http://consumernotebook.com/) to help you take detailed notes, using a grid as your buyer's worksheet.
68. If you live near public transit, consider giving up your car altogether.
69. Do you smoke? Quit and save hundreds or thousands of dollars each year.
70. Find a job closer to your home, to save on commuting costs. Or even better, find a telecommuting job. If you can't find a job that's closer to you, consider moving closer to your office.
71. Donate your old car or personal belongings to charity.  You'll be able to deduct the donation on your taxes.
72. Find a good accountant who can save you more on taxes than you can on your own.
73. Your local bakery outlet often has great deals on bread. 
74. Need tables for your dining and living rooms? Buy old wooden ones at garage sales.  It's okay if they have damage; simply cover them with a nice tablecloth.
75. When you feel like you're about to catch a cold, take extra vitamin C. If you take it in time, you can prevent yourself from getting sick and having to see a doctor or take time off from work.
76. Rather than buying craft materials for projects, find tutorials on Pinterest that show you DIY projects you can make by recycling items that you already have at home.
77. Save money for your children's education with a Section 529 plan as soon as they're born.
78. Contribute the maximum amount to your IRA each year.  Start an IRA account if you don't have one yet. Choose a conservative investment where you're unlikely to lose your money.
79. Whenever you're mailing books, magazines, CDs, or DVDs, bring the envelopes/boxes to the post office and send them via media mail.  That's how bookstores send out their book orders. It's the cheapest way to mail anything.
80. Rather than buying expensive custom window shades for large, oddly-shaped windows, sew 2 or more curtain pieces together. Use electrical conduit tubes as curtain rods for unusually large windows bigger than any of the standard curtain rods.
81. Plant fruit trees at your house. Imagine your house years from now, producing baskets of oranges, lemons, and apples for you.  Imagine being able to make fresh-squeezed orange juice for free every morning.
82. Get a second job to supplement your income. Or use an area of your expertise to do freelance work. Doing this is usually more efficient dollar for dollar than any of these lists of tips for being frugal.
83. If you use any of the local daily deal Groupon-type of websites, make sure that you spend only on the deals that you're absolutely sure you'll use. Don't ever let yourself forget to use a coupon; if you forget, stop your subscription to every daily deal list.
84. If you create a grid on [http://consumernotebook.com](http://consumernotebook.com/) to help you decide on a purchase, post it to Facebook/Twitter to get advice about it from trusted friends. 
85. Sleep on every major financial commitment before you go through with it. Don't ever decide on the spot.
86. If you eat a lot of dried fruit, vegetables, and/or beef or other jerky, get a food dehydrator and make your own.
87. Don't shop in bulk unless you're in the habit of making detailed spending budgets. You'll spend more each week at your local bulk warehouse store than you will at the grocery store.
88. If you mail a lot of letters and packages, use [http://stamps.com](http://stamps.com/) to print your own postage. You'll save hours and gas by not driving to the post office.
89. Learn how to bargain. Practice at garage sales. Bargaining skills will save you money for the rest of your life.
90. Whenever you have to drive to an event over 30 minutes away, try and carpool with others.  Trade off paying for gas with friends.
91. Instead of buying a laptop computer, get a tablet if all you're planning to use it for is browse the web, watch media, and email. Tablets are much cheaper, plus they're travel-friendly.
92. Participate in focus groups to earn extra cash on the side. Look on Craigslist and around local university bulletin boards for focus group and research study announcements.
93. Before you go to a restaurant, search online for coupons. It really doesn't take much effort to do so.
94. Try to hold off on your family's clothing shopping until Black Friday or the day after Christmas. The sales are much better on those two dates than during the rest of the year. Don't leat that hold you back if you see a particularly good sale, though.
95. If you have to order food for a large group, don't try to get too fancy with what you're ordering. Buy pizza if it's fine to  do so.
96. Learn how to do simple home repairs. Hire someone when you have to, but pick up a book and learn some of the basics.
97. If you have a pool, get a solar blanket for it.  Even if you have a gas pool heater, the solar blanket will help to keep the heat in.
98. Drive more efficiently. See [http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/driveHabits.shtml](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/driveHabits.shtml/) for tips.
99. If it's cold, open your curtains during the day to let sunlight in, heating your home naturally. At night, keep those curtains closed.
100. Make public wishlists on [http://consumernotebook.com](http://consumernotebook.com/) and share them with friends and family, so that they know to give you things that you actually need on your birthday and during the holidays.
