================

Lately, I've become dangerously obsessed with cheese.  I've started looking into making cheese at home.  

[Here's a comparison grid](http://consumernotebook.com/grids/audreyr/cheesemaking-kits/) of some of the cheesemaking kits I've found.  

The nice thing about the kits is that all the ingredients are known to work together properly, and the odds of failure are much lower (at least theoretically).

Some reviews say that you're better off just buying the ingredients separately and finding instructions online.  If you choose to do that, here's what to order online:

* rennet ([vegetarian](http://consumernotebook.com/fromase-rennet-one-10-tab-slip/4f4c743d580240000c000000/) or [animal](http://consumernotebook.com/liquid-animal-rennet-2-oz/4f4c7501b5cf97000e000000/) based)
* [citric acid](http://consumernotebook.com/citric-acid-100-pure/4f4c7574b5cf97000e000002/)
* [cheesecloth](http://consumernotebook.com/cheesecloth-commercial-grade-3-square-yards/4f4c76287f170d000d000000/)
* [cheese salt](http://consumernotebook.com/cheese-salt-8oz/4f4c771a5906e2000c000000/)
* [cheese wax](http://consumernotebook.com/red-cheese-wax/4f4c7862a84dd9000c000000/) if you're planning to make hard cheeses and age them
* starter culture
    * if you're just starting out, find a recipe that uses buttermilk or yogurt culture, like [this one](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/Fankhauser/Cheese/Cheese98.htm)
    * [mesophilic starter culture](http://consumernotebook.com/mesophilic-c101-chese-starter-culture-5-packets/4f4c7922bd8db8000c000000/) for hard, moderate temperature loving cheeses including Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Stilton, Edam, Gouda, Muenster, Blue, and Colby
    * [thermophilic starter culture](http://consumernotebook.com/thermophilic-c201-cheese-starter-culture-5-packets/4f4c79d0bd8db8000c000002/) for Parmesan, Romano and Swiss and other Italian style cheeses
* a food thermometer
    * [dial-style](http://consumernotebook.com/dial-thermometer/4f4c7a6abd8db8000e000000/) is probably good enough for simpler cheeses
    * [commercial digital waterproof](http://consumernotebook.com/taylor-9842-commercial-waterproof-digital-thermometer/4f4c7b335906e2000d000001/) is more accurate, though (and it's cheaper!)

In addition, beginner cheese making instructions typically require the following:

* a gallon of milk
* non-chlorinated water (bottled water)
* an 8-quart stainless steel pot (be extra-sure that you aren't using aluminum or cast iron)
* a cheese press
    * if you're on a tight budget and good with tools, build a [homemade press](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/Fankhauser/Cheese/Cheese98.htm)
    * otherwise, buy a well-made, calibrated one like [this one from Cabarrus Farms](http://consumernotebook.com/cheese-press-from-cabarrus-farms/4f4c82b45906e2000e000000/)

So that's what's in those cheese kits, and what you need in addition to the kits.  

Personally, I think I'm going to go with one of the low-cost kits for my first cheese, because I'm not sure I want to invest time into making a cheese press (or money into buying one) just yet.
