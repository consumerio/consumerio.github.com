================

A lot of comparison or product sites make their money by including various ad-links. We don't want that kind of site, and we've got what we think are some very good reasons why. Let's start with the design of many review sites:

There are a lot of problems with this sort of design. Here are three things we really don't like:

1. Ads take up screen real estate.
----------------------------------
You know how it is, a site seems useful but in reality all you get to read is a tiny column of text. The rest of the site is advertisements. Which means the site really doesn't have that much content. Consumer Notebook is all about useful content to help you make educated decisions about purchasing whatever you might want or need.


2. Ads can make you wonder if you can click on anything.
--------------------------------------------------------
Ever been to a ad-filled site and clicked on a link to a potentially interesting page that redirected you to a site full of pop-ups that took forever to close? Odds are you never went back to that site, right? Well, our tack is by not having advertisements we can keep that sort of thing away from your research efforts.

3. Ads make you worry about the validity of content.
----------------------------------------------------
We aren't paid spokespeople for anyone. Neither is our target audience. We are real consumers, not individuals who are writing or saying things from a script. You don't have to worry about us being influenced by whoever might be paying us to advertise their product on consumernotebook.com, because that isn't going to happen.

So what does our site look like?
---------------------------------

As you can see bewlow, we focus on clean design, useful data, and there isn't an ad on the page. Go ahead, click on it and explore the site yourself. :-)
